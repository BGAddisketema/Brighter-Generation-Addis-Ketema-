      Outcome Of The Project</h3>
      <p class="text" >
     Previously mentioned, our project's main aim was to reduce unemployment. We achieved this by helping three individuals facing challenges in distinct business fields: one aspiring to launch a tea and coffee venture, and two aiming to open a small market. During a follow-up visit after their businesses opened, we found them doing well, with one even actively innovating.
Project success stemmed from aligning with the needs of participating small businesses. We equipped them with tools to grow and thrive. Community support was crucial as well. They helped choose participating businesses and promoted them locally, forging customer connections.

  It's important to note that all involved businesses were led by women and single mothers residing in a low-income area. The project positively impacted all three ventures, enabling them to expand operations, hire more staff, and raise sales. The community reaped benefits too, as the businesses stimulated the local economy and created new jobs, fueling local economic growth and fostering entrepreneurship.

  <p class="text"> Important data regarding those who sought assistance was being gathered by the survey team. The answer to that important question is crucial in determining whether they can work together or not. Because of this, we can state that they fulfilled our project expectations. The skill and desire that the respondents displayed for working if we helped them shocked the survey team.
  <p class="text"> Therefore the tehcnical team obtained the material's cost and collaborated with the survey and data gathering team to determine their requirements. Then provide the people with their required materials.
